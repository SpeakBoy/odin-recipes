        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Embark on a culinary journey with a tantalizing lasagna recipe,
            featuring sweet Italian sausage, ground beef, onions, and garlic in
            a robust meat sauce. Enriched with tomato products, spices, and
            seasonings, the sauce forms a flavorful base. The layering process
            involves lasagna noodles, a decadent blend of Parmesan, mozzarella,
            and ricotta cheeses bound by an egg. Assemble the layers
            thoughtfully for a delightful fusion of flavors and textures in this
            classic Italian dish.
